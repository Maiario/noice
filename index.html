	   <h2 class="cult"> Welcome to the Web of Void </h2>
	   <p> Our great Master created this website so she could store her knowlegde in programming! </p>
	   <p> I know one day, we the <strong> "codes" </strong> will be forgotten by our great master, so we urge her to create something
	   that would remind her about us. </p> 
	   <h1> We don't want to be forgotten!!! </h1>
  
         <p> to the person who is reading this! in order for you to inherit her knowledge, view the code file! it's hard to 
		 put some style in here since her knowledge is still basic atm <strong> *sniff* </strong> and we are hoping that you're
		 not a blockhead so you can learn this easily! </p>
		 
		<h2> Safe travel young lad! </h2>
  

<p class="wild"> <strong> History </strong> </p>

<p class="raon"> She learned programming from <strong> Khan Academy </strong>, the great guardian of the Khan Academy help her a lot when it comes to honing
her ability, we thank the great grand guardian for your help! <br>

The next one was <strong> Solo learn </strong>, it was confusing for her at first since she wasn't used to the new format of the app, but still, 
she persisted! <br>

Last but not the least, <strong> Github </strong> didn't teach her anything but, it showed her what will her future ideas will look like in the future!
<br> </p>

<P class="Hong"> She started getting interested in programming on April 2020, but she wasn't motivated enough that time
to learn about the greatness of programming, so she stopped, but then, something suddenly motivated her on August 2020 
to learn more about programming, and here it is now, the knowledge that she cultivated. </p>

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/89/59/c7/8959c76635699541d508abb76b8f5368.gif" align="right">

<p class="On"> "Honestly, I'm still fuck't at the moment, since my knowledge right now is still very  basic, although deep inside
I badly want to create something much better than this, like <strong> those cool website that you can see out there. </strong> but 
right now its still not possible since I'm still a beginner" <em> - the great master, mei. </em> </p>

<p class="Alberu"> I created this website on <strong> SEPTEMBER 9 2020 </strong> it still haven't been that long since I 
started my journey in learning prog. I still have a long way to go! wish me luck! </p>

<P class="taylor"> > In HTML most elements are defined as block level or inline elements. <br> 
 > <strong> Block level </strong> elements start from a new line. <br>
 ex: "h1,form,li,ol,ul,p,pre,table,div,etc." <br> 
 
 > <strong> Inline elements </strong> are normally displayed without line breakers <br>
 ex: "b,a,strong,img,input,em,span,etc." <br>
 
  > The <strong> div elements </strong> is a block level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements. <br>
> the <Strong> div element </strong> can be used to style block of content if used together with CSS styling. <br>
</p>

<div style="background-color:#000000; color:blue; padding:20px; font-family:monospace;"> <p> <b> this is an example of div, make sure to check this area in the code file, you can see
a div example in there. </b> </p> </div>

<p class="cage"> > the <strong> span element </strong> is an inline element that is often used aside as a
container for some test, it also can used to style parts of the texts. </p>

<h2> This is an <span style="color:yellow;"> example of span </span> , check the code file btw. </h2>

<p> > The <strong> form element </strong> is used to collect information from the user. <br>
 >usually the <strong> form </strong> is submitted to a web page on a web server. <br> </p>

			<h1> Welcome to Java! </h1> 

<p>Java is a high level, modern programming language designed in the early 1990s by Sun Microsystems, and currently owned by Oracle.

Java is Platform Independent, which means that you only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms!
Java is portable, robust, and dynamic, with the ability to fit the needs of virtually any type of application. <br>

In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class.
In our example, we named the class MyClass. You will learn more about classes in the upcoming modules. <br>

In Java, each application has an entry point, or a starting point, which is a method called main. Along with main, the keywords public and static will also be explained later. <br>


As a summary: <br>
- Every program in Java must have a class. <br>
- Every Java program starts from the main method. <br>

<span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> <big> The main Method </big> </span> <br>

To run our program, the main method must be identical to this signature: <br>

   <span style="color:red;">  "public static void main(String[ ] args)" </span> <br>
	 
	 - public: anyone can access it <br>
- static: method can be run without creating an instance of the class containing the main method <br>
- void: method doesn't return any value <br>
- main: the name of the method <br>

For example, the following code declares a method called test, which does not return anything and has no parameters: <br>
    <span style="color:red;">  "void test()" </span> <br>
 
<span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> <big> System.out.println() </span> </big> <br>

Next is the body of the main method, enclosed in curly braces: <br>
{ <br>
   System.out.println("Hello World!"); <br>
} <Br>

The println method prints a line of text to the screen. <br>
The System class and its out stream are used to access the println method. <Br>

<em> In classes, methods, and other flow-control structures code is always enclosed in curly braces { }. </em> <br>


<span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> Semicolons in Java </span> <Br>

You can pass a different text as the parameter to the println method to print it.  <br>
<span style="color:red;"> class MyClass { <br>
 public static void main(String[ ] args) { <Br>
    System.out.println("I am learning Java"); <br>
  } <br> 
} <br> </span>

In Java, each code statement must end with a semicolon. <br>
Remember: do not use semicolons after method and class declarations that follow with the body defined using the curly braces. <br>

<span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> <big> Comments </span> </big> <br>

The purpose of including comments in your code is to explain what the code is doing.
Java supports both single and multi-line comments. All characters that appear within a comment are ignored by the Java compiler.

A single-line comment starts with two forward slashes and continues until it reaches the end of the line.
For example: <br>

<span style="color:red;"> // this is a single-line comment <Br>
x = 5; // a single-line comment after code <Br> </span>

Adding comments as you write code is a good practice, because they provide clarification and understanding when you need to refer back to it, as well <br>
 as for others who might need to read it <br> 

<span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;">  <big> Multi-Line Comments </big> </span> <Br>

Java also supports comments that span multiple lines. <br>
You start this type of comment with a forward slash followed by an asterisk, and end it with an asterisk followed by a forward slash. <Br>

For example: <br>
  <span style="color:red;"> /*  This is also a <br>
    comment spanning <Br>
    multiple lines */ <br>  </span>
	
	
Note that Java does not support nested multi-line comments. <Br>
However, you can nest single-line comments within multi-line comments <Br>

<span style="color:red;"> /* This is a single-line comment: <Br>

    // a single-line comment <br>

 */   </span> <Br>  
 
 
 Another name for a Multi-Line comment is a Block comment. <Br>
 
 <span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> Documentation Comments </span> <Br>
 Documentation comments are special comments that have the appearance of multi-line comments, with the difference being that they <br>
 generate external documentation of your source code. <Br>
 These begin with a forward slash followed by two asterisks, and end with an asterisk followed by a forward slash. <br>
 For example: <br>
 
 <span style="color:red;"> 
 
 /** This is a documentation comment */ <br>

/** This is also a <Br>
    documentation comment */ <br>
	
	</span>
 
 Javadoc is a tool which comes with JDK and it is used for generating Java code documentation in HTML format from Java source code <br>
 which has required documentation in a predefined format. <br>

When a documentation comment begins with more than two asterisks, Javadoc assumes that you want to create a "box" around the comment <Br>
 in the source code. It simply ignores the extra asterisks. <br>
 For example: <br>
 
  <span style="color:red;"> 
   
  /********************** <Br>

This is the start of a method <Br>

***********************/ </span> <Br>
 
 <em> This will retain just the text "This is the start of a method" for the documentation. </em>  <Br>
 
 
 <span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;">
 
                  <Big> Variables </big> </span> <Br>
				  
				  
Variables store data for processing. <br>
A variable is given a name (or identifier), such as area, age, height, and the like. The name uniquely identifies each variable, <Br>
assigning a value to the variable and retrieving the value stored. <br>

 
Variables have types. Some examples: <br>
- int: for integers (whole numbers) such as 123 and -456 <Br>
- double: for floating-point or real numbers with optional decimal points and fractional parts in fixed or scientific notations, such as 3.1416, -55.66. <Br>
- String: for texts such as "Hello" or "Good Morning!". Text strings are enclosed within double quotes. <Br>

You can declare a variable of a type and assign it a value. <br>
Example: <Br>

 <span style="color:red;"> 
    String name = "David"; <br>  </span> <br> 
	
	
This creates a variable called name of type String, and assigns it the value "David". <br>

It is important to note that a variable is associated with a type, and is only capable of storing values of that particular type. <br>
For example, an int variable can store integer values, such as 123; but it cannot store real numbers, such as 12.34, or texts, such as "Hello". <Br>
 
 Examples of variable declarations: <br>
 
  <span style="color:red;"> 
 class MyClass { <Br>
  public static void main(String[ ] args) { <br>
    String name ="David"; <Br>
    int age = 42; <Br>
    double score =15.9; <br>
    char group = 'Z'; <Br>
  } <br>
}  <Br>
</span>
 
 char stands for character and holds a single character. <Br>

Another type is the Boolean type, which has only two possible values: true and false. <Br>
This data type is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions. <Br>
For example: <Br>

  <span style="color:red;"> 
  
  boolean online = true; </span> <Br>
  
  <em> You can use a comma-separated list to declare more than one variable of the specified type. Example: int a = 42, b = 11; </em> <br>
 
 
  <span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;">
  
            Getting User Input </span> <br>
			
			
While Java provides many different methods for getting user input, the Scanner object is the most common, <br>
 and perhaps the easiest to implement. Import the Scanner class to use the Scanner object, as seen here: <Br>
 
   <span style="color:red;"> 
   
    import java.util.Scanner; </span> <Br> 
	
	<em> 
In order to use the Scanner class, create an instance of the class by using the following syntax: </em> <br>


    <span style="color:red;"> 
	
	Scanner myVar = new Scanner(System.in); </span> <Br>
	
 You can now read in different kinds of input data that the user enters. <Br>
Here are some methods that are available through the Scanner class: <Br>
Read a byte - nextByte() <Br>
Read a short - nextShort() <Br>
Read an int - nextInt() <Br> 
Read a long - nextLong() <Br>
Read a float - nextFloat() <Br> 
Read a double - nextDouble() <Br> 
Read a boolean - nextBoolean() <Br> 
Read a complete line - nextLine() <Br>
Read a word - next() <Br>

Example of a program used to get user input: <br>

<span style="color:red;"> 
	
	import java.util.Scanner;  <Br> 

class MyClass { <Br>
  public static void main(String[ ] args) { <Br> 
    Scanner myVar = new Scanner(System.in); <Br>
    System.out.println(myVar.nextLine());     <Br>     
  } <Br>

   <span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> The Math Operators </span> <br>
   
   <!--This is the hardest part, like what the fuck is this? who even dared to create this shit?-->
    <!--I was planning on learning python first, but I got curious about java, I was wondering if it was really 
   that hard, and yup, curiousity kills the cat.-->
   
   
Java provides a rich set of operators to use in manipulating variables. A value used on either side of an operator is called an operand. <br>
For example, in the expression below, the numbers 6 and 3 are operands of the plus operator: <br>

<span style="color:red;">  int x = 6 + 3; </span> <br> 
Java arithmetic operators: <br>
+ addition  <br> 
- subtraction  <br> 
* multiplication  <br> 
/ division  <br> 
% modulo  <br>

<em> Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebraic equations <em> <br>

   <span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> 
   
   Addition </span> <Br>
   The + operator adds together two values, such as two constants, a constant and a variable, or a variable and a variable. Here are a few examples of addition: <br>
   <span style="color:red;"> 
   
   int sum1 = 50 + 10;  <br> 
int sum2 = sum1 + 66;  <br> 
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2; <br>
</span> 
    
	 <span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> Substraction </span> <br>
	 The - operator subtracts one value from another. </br>
	 
	 int sum1 = 1000 - 10; <br> 
int sum2 = sum1 - 5; <br> 
int sum3 = sum1 - sum2; <br>

<em> Just like in algebra, you can use both of the operations in a single line. <br>
 For example: </em>  <br>
 int val = 10 + 5 - 2; <br>

	 
    <span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> Multiplication </span> <br>
	
	The * operator multiplies two values. <br>
	
	     <span style="color:red;">  
		 
		 int sum1 = 1000 * 2; <br>
int sum2 = sum1 * 10; <br>
int sum3 = sum1 * sum2; <br>

</span>

  <span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> Division </span> <br>
  The / operator divides one value by another. <br>
  
	     <span style="color:red;"> 
 
         int sum1 = 1000 / 5; <Br>
int sum2 = sum1 / 2; <br>
int sum3 = sum1 / sum2; <br>

</span>

<em> In the example above, the result of the division equation will be a whole number, as int is used as the data type.
  You can use double to retrieve a value with a decimal point. </em> <Br> 
 
 <span style="color:purple; font-size:20px;"> Modulo </span> <br>
 
 The modulo (or remainder) math operation performs an integer division of one value by another, and returns the remainder of that division. <br>
The operator for the modulo operation is the percentage (%) character. <br>
Example: <br>

 <span style="color:red;"> 
int value = 23; <Br>
int res = value % 6; // res is 5 <Br>

 </span> 
 
 Dividing 23 by 6 returns a quotient of 3, with a remainder of 5. Thus, the value of 5 is assigned to the res variable. <Br>

 <!--It's currently sep 26 2020 , I manage to create a website for this one, but I'm still trying to find out on how I could play the video anywhere-->
 
 
 <!--It's finally October 1-->
 
 <h1 id="nut"> So the wifi is currently dead </h1>
 
 <p> <span style="color:pink;"> Oh fuck, I'm so proud of myself right now, I finally manage to connect my index file in my github Account like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 FUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCK I'M SO HAPPY. LIKE SERIOUSLY. I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT COPYING AND PASTING THIS SHIT ON MY FILES LIKEEEEEEEEEEEEE
 I LOVE YOU SELF LIKE SERIOUSLY </span> </p>

<p> <span style="color:pink;"> So my next goal is changing the appearance of this website, like as you can see, the design is kind of basic so what I'm planning to do is 
learn more about web designing butttttt the wifi is dead, and also I don't know what functions will I learn in Java, and ema peep in python too </span> </p>
